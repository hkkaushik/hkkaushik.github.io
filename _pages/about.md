<!-- I am a professor of mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://home.iitd.ac.in) in Delhi. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at INRIA Bordeaux, France, and Seminar for Applied Mathematics, D-MATH, ETH Zurich. My research interest is in computational mathematics. In particular, my group works on designing stable numerical methods for PDEs arising from fluid and plasma flows. These are often modeled via PDEs, which have discontinuous solutions. We design finite-volume, finite-difference, and discontinuous Galerkin methods for these PDEs and analyze these methods' theoretical and numerical stabilities.

My CV can be found [here](assets/pdf/Harish_CV.pdf). -->
